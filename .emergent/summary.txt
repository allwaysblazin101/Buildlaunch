<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user requested to build a complete renovation job marketplace website named “Build Launch”. The platform allows homeowners in Mississauga, Toronto, and Brampton to post renovation jobs. Contractors can browse and bid on these jobs for free. A key requirement is an escrow system managed by Build Launch, where homeowners pay upfront, and the funds are released to the contractor (minus a 10% fee) upon job completion. The business phone number, 416-697-1728, must be included in the footer and on the contact page.

During the session, the user also requested:
- A design similar to emergen.io.
- Notifications and contractor verification.
- A lighter, more refined dark theme (not pure black).
- A photo gallery for jobs.
- A custom logo and a full background image.
- A more interactive UI with animations.
- Admin access with security enhancements (rate limiting, password strength).
- Addition of pages like FAQ, About, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy.
- Implementation of features like contractor public profiles, real file uploads for jobs, and advanced search filters (by rating, price range).
- Finally, the user asked if the site is production-ready and how to convert it into a mobile app.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been developed with a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and a MongoDB database.

- **Backend**: Includes JWT-based authentication for homeowners, contractors, and an admin role. It features CRUD APIs for jobs and bids, a Stripe-integrated escrow payment system, and admin-only endpoints for management. Security features like rate limiting and password validation have been implemented. The  library for email notifications is installed, but the logic is not yet implemented.

- **Frontend**: Features a professional, interactive dark theme inspired by emergen.io. It includes a custom logo, a landing page with a full background image and parallax effects, and numerous pages such as Landing, Auth, Dashboards, Job Details, Admin Panel, About, and FAQ. A photo gallery for jobs is present but currently uses sample images. The business phone number is displayed in the navbar, footer, and on hero call-to-action buttons.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent was in the middle of implementing a large feature bundle requested by the user. This included creating Terms/Privacy pages, enabling email notifications, building contractor profiles, implementing real file uploads, and adding advanced search filters. The agent had already installed the  email dependency, created the new frontend pages (, , ), and updated the  page to include the UI for the new filters. The work was interrupted before the backend logic for these features could be implemented.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: both
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs. The current focus is on implementing new features.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Implement a large set of new features** (P0)
    - **Where to resume**: The agent should resume by implementing the backend logic for the recently added frontend components.
        1.  Integrate a file storage solution for real image uploads and update the  endpoint.
        2.  Implement the  email service in  to handle notifications (e.g., on new bids, job completion).
        3.  Add the backend logic in  to filter jobs by rating and price range.
        4.  Connect the  page to a new backend endpoint to fetch contractor-specific data (e.g., reviews, past jobs).
        5.  Add links to the new  and  pages in the site's footer.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: The application will be significantly more feature-complete, with legal pages, functional email notifications, public contractor profiles, real job photos, and advanced job searching capabilities.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    - **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **P0: Address user's query on production readiness and mobile app conversion.** The agent must first call the  to provide a comprehensive answer to the user's question: Is the webpage ready for production? And how do I make it into an app?.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - Based on a previous agent suggestion, implement an SMS notification system using Twilio for instant bid alerts to contractors.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full-Stack Application MVP**: Built the core platform with user roles, job posting, and bidding functionality.
- **Stripe Escrow Integration**: Implemented the complete payment flow, from checkout to fund release.
- **Advanced UI/UX Overhaul**: Redesigned the frontend to be highly interactive with a custom logo, parallax background, animated elements, and a refined dark theme ().
- **Admin Panel & Security**: Created a secure admin dashboard with management capabilities and hardened the application with rate limiting and password validation (, ).
- **Content & Feature Expansion**: Added About, FAQ, and 404 pages, a photo gallery for jobs, and placed the business phone number in prominent locations.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved issues with Shadcn Select components and user profile displays identified by the testing agent.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. All issues that were identified during the session have been addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- No recurrence issues were noted from a previous fork.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Payments**: Stripe (Escrow)
- **Architecture**: Single Page Application (SPA)

**key DB schema**
- **users**: 
- **jobs**: 
- **bids**: 
- **reviews**: 
- **payment_transactions**: 

**changes in tech stack**
- No changes were made to the core tech stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB).

**All files of reference**
- **/app/backend/server.py**: The monolithic backend file containing all API routes, database models, and business logic.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main frontend router that defines all page routes and manages the authentication context.
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/Landing.js**: The highly interactive and visually rich landing page.
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/BrowseJobs.js**: The page for browsing jobs, recently updated with UI for advanced filters.
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.js**: The UI for the administrator to manage users and jobs.
- **/app/backend/.env**: Contains all secrets, including database credentials, Stripe keys, and admin login info.
- **/app/memory/PRD.md**: The project requirements document.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file has grown to over 900 lines. It should be modularized by splitting the API logic into separate FastAPI  files (e.g., , , ) to improve maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
- , , 
-  (CRUD for jobs)
-  (Create bids)
-  (Stripe payment)
-  (Stripe event handler)
- ,  (Admin management)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Your first action must be to address the user's pending question**: Is the webpage ready for production? And how do I make it into an app?. You MUST call the  to get a standardized answer for this.
- After addressing the user's question, you need to resume the **in-progress task** of implementing the large feature set: real file uploads, email notifications (), advanced search filters, and contractor public profiles. The backend logic for these features is the main missing piece.
-  is a single large file. Consider this for future refactoring efforts after completing the current feature set.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: The backend logic for advanced search filters, email notifications, and real file uploads is missing.
- **Mocked**: The job photo gallery and image upload functionality currently use static, hardcoded sample images, not real user uploads.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Stripe (Payments)**: Integrated for escrow payments. Uses a system-provided test key.
- **Resend (Email)**: The  library is installed, and a playbook exists. The integration is pending implementation and will require a  from the user.

**Testing status**
